npm init -y

npm install bcrypt express jsonwebtoken mongoose nodemon

node src/index.js but because we created a script on package.json we can run "npm run dev"

express: to create the application and communicate to server
mongoose: to connect to mongodb
nodemon: use it to make automated refresh on changes, this should be applied to package.json script
bcrypt: to encrypt or hash the passwords



we have to download https://www.postman.com/downloads/ to make requests and test application :)
